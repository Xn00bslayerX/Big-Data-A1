# Big-Data-A1

Big-Data-A1 is a data analysis and visualization project for a Big Data assignment. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to explore, analyze, and visualize datasets relevant to the assignment objectives.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Analyze large datasets using Python libraries and present findings through visualizations.
- **Features:**  
  - Automated data download and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis  
  - Generation of insightful visualizations  
  - Step-by-step explanations within the notebook

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `assignment1.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook assignment1.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the notebook cells to:
    - Download necessary data files
    - Perform data analysis
    - Generate visualizations

## Files

- `assignment1.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for interactive data visualization.
- Data files: Downloaded automatically by the notebook.

## Usage

Run the notebook to download the necessary data files and perform all analysis. Next, run app.py to launch the Streamlit app for interactive visualizations.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
